class OverflierClimberExtendedScenario(ScenarioAlgorithm):
    """
    An extended overflier-climber scenario generator for I, X, Y airspace sectors.

    The extended scenario is similar to the simple overflier-climber scenario implemented in OverflierClimberScenario,
    except that the start positions of both aircraft are modified to include an additional separation of arbitrary
    duration (the "thinking time").

    This modification has the effect of making an immediate climb potentially optimal (whereas in the simple
    overflier-climber scenario such a policy would lead, by construction, to a loss of separation).

    This algorithm assumes that each aircraft's route is a straight line path to the sector centre,
    as is the case in an I, X or Y sector element.

    Args:
        trajectory_predictor: Simple trajectory predictor offering cruise speed, climb time and downtrack distance estimates.

    Attributes:
        trajectory_predictor: Simple trajectory predictor offering cruise speed, climb time and downtrack distance estimates.
